            <h2>Zamboanga City</h2>
            <p>Zamboanga City was founded by Spanish forces in 1635 on the site of a native settlement. Its name is derived from the Malay jambangan (“place of flowers”), and bougainvillea, orchids, and other tropical flowers line its roadsides. Fort Pilar, the shrine of Our Lady of the Pillar, was built in the 17th century for the protection of Christian settlers against Moro (local Muslim) pirates; it now houses a branch of the national museum. The city is also the site of Western Mindanao State University (founded 1918). Incorporated in 1936, the city was largely rebuilt after World War II.</p>
